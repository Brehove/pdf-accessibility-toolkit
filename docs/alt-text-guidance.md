# Alt Text Guidance (Higher Ed)

## Core rules
- Keep alt text concise and specific.
- Focus on what students need to learn from the image.
- Avoid "image of" unless needed for clarity.

## Recommended patterns
- Photo/illustration: summarize the educationally relevant content.
- Chart/graph: include the trend or key comparison.
- Diagram/process: include the main relationship or sequence.
- Equation screenshot: provide readable equation text or direct users to nearby equation text.

## Length guidance
- Target <= 120 characters for simple images.
- For complex visuals, use concise alt text plus nearby explanatory paragraph.

## Common weak alt text to fix
- Filenames (`img_0123`, `figure1.png`)
- Generic labels (`image`, `photo`, `diagram`)
- OCR leftovers with no meaning
